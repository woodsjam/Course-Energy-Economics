## Where is it produced? Just conventional
![](us_gas_production_in_conventional_fields-2009.jpg)


## More in the shale areas.

## Fracking Well. Will see with oil well with associated gas

## How do you move it within the US? Pipelines.

## What about those pipelines?
+ There are more intrastate pipelines than shown, plenty in TX and CA but also other states
+ Picture pipes ranging from a foot to three+ feet for trunk lines.
+ Compressor stations every 50-100 miles, ~1,500 total
+ 200 psi to 1,500 depending
+ They are privately owned 
    + Open access, posted prices, is a thing.
    + For intrastate, within, state PUC regulate
    + For interstate, FERC regulates (You can find current Tariffs at http://etariff.ferc.gov/TariffList.aspx)
    
## Compressors

## Storage is important

![](chart3.png)

## Most Storage is just old gas wells

## Storage is very seasonal

There is a weekly report on storage by EIA http://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/nw2_epg0_swo_r48_bcfw.htm

+ Note the seasonality
+ Note the factor of 2+ changes over the term


## Hubs, where transactions are made

![](MarketCenterHubsMap.png) 

## Part of Henry Hub LA

## Getting to Prices
+ You will see wellhead prices, but
+ Most references prices are at the hubs.  
    + Henry Hub in LA is the most common reference hub for prices
    + There are fairly firm relationships between other hubs and HH except when there is congestion.
    + Changes in the usual difference are usually called basis blowout. Term is not specific to energy.

+ Intercontinental Exchange for Gas Itself
    + https://www.theice.com/products/OTC/Physical-Energy/Natural-Gas
+ FERC for transportation tariffs (Regulated)
    + http://etariff.ferc.gov/TariffList.aspx
    + Some are fixed and some have a market rate component.
+ EIA has easier access to prices https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdM.htm

It is hard to talk about gas separate from transportation.
    
## Intro Deregulation in Natural Gas    

+ Transmission companies used to own the gas. 
    + Buy on one end
    + Sell on the other
+ Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 started the process ... but didn't work well
+ FERC 236 1985 simplified product definitions
+ FERC 636 in 1992 was were it really started.

## Key Points about Deregulation in General

+ The point is not to keep hands off and let the markets develop into whatever form they want.
    + There is a balance between minimizing transactions cost, which your book focuses on, and efficiency.
    + Markets will tend to reduce transactions cost, merging etc, but that does not make for efficient allocation.
+ The idea is to create market rules that balance allocative efficiency and transaction cost minimization.
    + Focus on all transactions being visible in some way. (Competition requires a good information environment)
    + Focus on reducing market power (Why pipelines can't own the gas in them any more.)
    + Open access (Law of one price)
    + Put a price on everything
        + Storage
        + Timing and reliability of transport access
        + Unbundling of prices.
        
        
        
## Transactions Cost Economics

Goes back to Coase 1937 (Nobel).  Williamson (Nobel also), Elinor Ostrom (Nobel too), Hart and Holstrom (2016 Nobel)

Transactions are not cost free:

  + Search and information cost (Coordination)
  + Bargaining (Defining what you want)
  + Enforcement (Getting people to do what they said)
  + Strategic behavior (Hold Up Problem) Transaction specific investments

Minimizing Transaction Cost often means vertically integrating:

  + Merge with your suppliers or with who you supply.
  + Working with only one internal supplier may minimize current costs but may not provide incentives to reduce further.
  + Larger firms often mean more market power in terminal market.
  
  
## Intent of regulation is to get closer to perfect competition

  + Information rich
  + Minimized market power
  + Information is contained in prices
  + There are a lot of prices
  + Complex trading floor operations to control cost and risk.
