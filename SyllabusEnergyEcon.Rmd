# Course Description

The official description of the course is:

> Economics and structure of energy markets, with a focus on electricity. Examines current policy issues arising from energy production and use.

This is a companion course to EC 437/537 which will address regulatory and competitive policies in electricity, public transportation, water, natural, and telecommunications. The order of the courses has changed to reflect the evolving nature of the field.

I provide two paths through this course. The first path focuses on a term paper. The second is more focused on classroom discussion, homework and exams.

The term paper path requires some qualification steps. If quality and progress are not sufficient to produce a reasonable term paper, you will be shifted back to the second, more traditional path with significant make up work in the later half of the course.

## Prerequisites

The undergraduate section has microeconomic theory, EC 311, or the calculus based version, EC 415, listed as prerequisites. The graduate section requires only graduate standing.

# COVID-19

The PSU campus is set to open with all students and faculty vaccinated and that everything will go back to normal.

If they mentioned a free pony -- I missed it.

## Health and Safety

Viri mutate. Large parts of the world, parts of our state, and many sub-populations, e.g., children, are unvaccinated. This gives rise to new strains and the *possibility* that our current vaccines are less effective against these emerging strains than the existing ones.

I will be applying an abundance of caution and planning for the possibility of another move to fully remote learning as Fall continues. In the mean time I will set up the class so you can join remotely or in-person.

We will also be following a few simple practices:

-   Office hours will generally be held in covered rooftop area on the fourth floor of the Urban Center Building. I'll be easy to spot.

-   ~~If you have a cough, cold, runny nose or `think you are comming down with something`,~~ wear a mask in class or join remotely.

# Contact Information

Communication will be handled through slack <http://woodseconomics.slack.com/>. You should have received an invitation, if not, just go to that URL and use this link () and your @pdx.edu email to sign up. There are reasonable help documents to get you started (<https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users>)

Slack will be used for IM, email and forum style communication. It even handles phone and video calls. If you have a question about course material or the course itself, ask in one of the channels, e.g., \#general. If you have a personal message that is not intended for others, send a direct message, i.e., @woodsj.

Office Hours:

-   In-person office hours are Monday 3:30-5:30pm on the rooftop area of the urban center building or online if we move to remote, and Tuesdays 10:00-11:30 on zoom only, through the last week of class.
-   You can schedule one-on-one meetings at <https://woodsj.youcanbook.me/>. These will be online meetings through zoom.

# Basis for Grade

The two paths through the class have many of the same requirements but very different emphasis.

Unless you opt-in to writing a term paper and show satisfactory preparation and performance, you will be on the Discussion and Exams path.

Early in the term you will have the option of doing some preliminary work to demonstrate your ability to write a term paper and construct a viable topic. These are the small writing sample and abstract assignments listed below.  If you demonstrate your preparation and propose a reasonable topic, you are on the term paper track.

This path has multiple check-in points and as long as you are making satisfactory progress you will continue on this path. If you get too far behind or the quality of the interim product is low, I will unilaterally shift you back to the Discussion and Exams Path with additional make up work.

## Basis for Grade: Discussion and Exams

Course grades will be determined by your performance as both a creator of table reads, briefly explained below but expanded  later, your participation in those table reads, homework assignments, a midterm and a final. In short, with the exception of the table read, it is a traditional class set up.

The proportion of your grade from each task is defined below.

-   Table Read Creation and Leadership: 30%
-   Table Read Participation: 10%
-   Homework: 20%
-   Midterm (): 20%
-   Final () : 20%

## Basis for Grade; Term Paper

Some students may wish to spend the majority of the term doing a deep dive on a topic of their choice or producing a technical writing sample or a paper that can be delivered at an academic conference.

I have paid the conference fees for students to present.

-   Table Read Participation: 15%
-   Final Draft of Term Paper: 20%
-   Draft Term Paper: 25%
-   Presentation of Paper Topic: 15%
-   Annotated Bibliography: 23%
-   Abstract: 1%
-   Writing Sample: 1%

These students are still required to be present in class and to have read the material.  Note that some of the grade is based on table read participation.

Students that are taking this path start by submitting a writing sample with a bibliography and citations from a previous class.  If the writing is of passable quality you will be allowed to construct a draft abstract. 

Once your abstract is submitted we will meet to re-frame to topic into something reasonable for a 10-week course and your skill set.

The annotated bibliography is the key step.  This should be your first outline of your paper.  It should include most of your key references and describe how you will use them in your paper.  If you don't demonstrate sufficient progress and organization at this stage, you will be transitioned back to discussion and exams.

If there is a good start, then you can proceed and we can schedule an in-class presentation on your interim work.

Please note that the draft paper is worth more than the final draft.  The draft paper should be mostly complete but lacking a little polish.

## Transitioning Back to Discussion and Exams

Some students will start down the term paper path and find that it isn't for them, either because they were too optimistic, their time constraints have changed, or the project is just not working.

You can voluntarily transition back right after the annotated bibliography. I may force you back onto the discussion and exam path if your progress is insufficient.

Your basis for grade will become:

-   Abstract: 1%
-   Writing Sample: 1%
-   Table Read Creation and Leadership: 23%
-   Table Read Participation: 20%
-   Homework: 15%
-   Midterm (): 20%
-   Final () : 20%

There will also be some reworking of the table read assignments. Those that continued on the exam path will have fewer assignments to allow those that did not have table read assignments, while they worked on term papers, to catch up.

If you are transitioning back to the exam path from the term paper path, plan on a very serious workload commitment in the later half of the class to catch up.

To be clear, transitioning away from the term paper is much harder than completing it or never starting.

## Which Path?

Students have a much wider range of preparation than in the past. Even with the same classes, students arrive with vastly different experience, abilities and skill sets.

Pick what works for you, but don't focus on strategic short-term advantages. It is very easy to start on the term paper path, get behind, and then have to transition back to the exam path at the end of the term just as your other classes are ramping up.

Sticking with one option is easy.  

## What Ifs

# The In-class Experience

## Table Reads

## Exam Days

For those on the exam path, there is both a midterm and a final exam in this class. These are different from the homework assignments, which focus on one chapter or article at a time. The questions will require you to synthesize what you have learned, comparing and contrasting, using models and data from multiple sources to support your argument.

These are open-note, open-book exams, but that should indicate that these are more difficult questions. Don't expect to burn through some algebra problems. If you are familiar with Costa's levels of inquiry, these are level three questions. The homework will tend to be level two and one.

A set of potential questions will be distributed ahead of the exams. Only a subset or variation of the questions will be chosen for the exam.

On exam day a Google doc will be shared with you. You should complete your work in that document. If you need to include diagrams or mathematical derivations and don't want to spend the time you can do those on paper, take a photo and upload it to the associated D2L assignment folder. Each photo should be labeled, e.g., figure 1, with corresponding text in your Google doc to indicate where the figure should be included.

As per normal, exams are intended to measure individual performance. The work you turn in should be authentically yours. Communication between students during the exam is not allowed.

## Participatory Grading

The graduate assistant and I will be grading the bulk of the homework, exams, term papers and the like but you will have input on a few grades.

Students producing a term paper have to perform a presentation. You will be asked for feedback on their presentation.

Since multiple students will be assigned the same sections of papers and textbook for table reads, the easiest way to grade is based on the relative quality of the material.

Each of you will have a single vote per section. The instructor will have 2 or 3 depending on the size of the class. Grades will be determined by an [instant runoff vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting).
